Adaptation for Magento of ACF | Advanced Custom Fields Plugin for WordPress 

You can add unlimited custom fields (text, text area, link, images, and files) to each cms block and page with the dynamic rows UI.  You can choose the display order of each field including the native WYSIWYG.   You can add a class and level to each field, which enables the developer to create the structure of the initial stylesheet when creating the site. This enable the client to be more autonomous when re-publishing the content.   What makes your extension unique :   

Often when we create the site, the client does not know how to make HTML/CSS. They do not want to touch WYSIWYG which includes HTML for fear of breaking everything. The client continues to ask that the management of pages and blocks be much easier. CMS Advanced Custom Fields was created to make it easier. With the principle of custom fields, the customer has to change the contents of the fields to update his page without changing the DOM structure of the page.
